\section{Problem}

The problem asks us to solve 1,000 individual, independent problems. We will look at a single one.

Given two inputs:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A: $ \{a_1, a_2, ... a_n \mid a \in \{.|\#|?\}\}$
  \item B: $ \{b_1, b_2, ... b_n \mid b \in \mathbb{N} \}$
\end{itemize}

That is, A is a string of characters that are either \texttt{.}, \texttt{\#}, or \texttt{?}, and B is an ordered set of integers. 


Let's define an element $\mathbb{S}_n$ as a a contiguous subset of A, $\{ a_m, a_{m+1}, ..\}\mid \forall a \in \{ \# \}$

Let's define an element $\mathbb{S?}_n$ as a a contiguous subset of A, $\{ a_m, a_{m+1}, ..\}\mid \forall a \in \{ \#, . \}$

Then, $B[y]$ is equal to the length of the element $\mathbb{S}_y$. 

The question marks in A are wildcards, and can be either \texttt{.} or \texttt{\#}. 

$ T_y1(A) $ is a transformation function which replaces each \texttt{?} in A with a specific set \texttt{.} or \texttt{\#} values, such that the length of the resulting elements $\mathbb{S}_y$ is equal to $B[y]$. That is to say, that they solve the given constraints. We must find the number of different valid $T_n(A)$ functions. 

\section{Analysis}

Given a head element $\mathbb{S?_0}$ of length $n$ and a head $B[0]$ of length $m$:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If $n - m < 0$, then there are no valid $T_0(S?)$ functions, and this path is invalid. 
  \item If $n - m == 0$, then there is only one valid $T_0(S?)$ function, which is replaces any \texttt{?} with \texttt{\#}.
  \item If $n - m > 0$, then there are multiple valid $T_n(S?)$.
\end{itemize}

If $n - m > 0$, then we are in a situation where we have some amount of \texttt{?}, and some amount of \texttt{\#}-- and we need to create a grouping around the existing \texttt{\#}
